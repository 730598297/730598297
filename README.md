Object-oriented programming, 
Troubleshooting skills, 
Game Development, 
Teamwork and Collaboration, 
git, 
Docker

### Classes
Introduction to Programming and Data Science · Comp 110: In the course, I was introduced to programming and data science from a computational perspective, focusing on modern applications in society. I gained valuable experience in foundational concepts like algorithms, data types, and ethical computing, all without needing any prior programming experience.

Special Topics in Computer Science · Comp 290: I’m currently taking a course on non-technical topics in computer science, which isn’t used to satisfy any degree requirements for my major. The content varies, and I can take it multiple times for credit, allowing me to explore different aspects of the field that aren’t purely technical.

Data Structures and Analysis · Comp 210: I’m currently taking a course that teaches me how to organize data in computer programs for efficient manipulation of large problems and data sets. Instead of just learning to use the data structures from programming libraries, I'm diving into how those libraries are constructed and understanding the rationale behind the included and excluded items.

Discrete Structures · Comp 283: I'm currently studying discrete structures, including sets, tuples, relations, functions, graphs, and trees, along with the formal mathematics like logic, proof, and induction that establish their properties. This course is enhancing my problem-solving skills through puzzles and applications that are central to computer science.

### Tools and Programming Languages
I currently know:
Java, 
Python

I will learn:
CSS, 
JavaScript, 
HTML, 
React

### Projects
Hangman
Python
(Developing) (In GUI): A standard Hangman game.

FUTURE PROJECT: Wildlife Simulator
Python
(Developing) (Terminal): A project designed to simulate a week-long period, tracking the populations of bears and fish.

Password
Python
(Developing) (Terminal): A simple game utilizing conditional statements and loops. Despite its title, "Password," the project is not related to security.

FUTURE WEBSITE: Website
Python 
(Developing): A website that I will create with DJANGO that contains all of these projects and information about me. (This would be a resume and also contain my Resume.pdf.)

Food Filter
Python
(Developing) (in GUI): Upon clicking on the screen, the user will be navigated to a subsequent page that displays a comprehensive list of items, each accompanied by detailed information. This page functions similarly to a food catalog, presenting items with associated photos, descriptions, and filter options to assist the user in locating their desired selection.

Math Game for Kids
Java
(Developing) (In GUI and Terminal): The program generates randomized math problems encompassing addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, specifically designed for children to solve.

Number Guessing Game
Java
(Developing) (In GUI and Terminal): The program generates a random number and provides the user with three attempts to guess it correctly. On the final attempt, the program presents a math equation; if the user successfully solves the equation, they win.
